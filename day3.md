## Challenge Setup

This challenge wasn't particularly difficult, but did require quite a bit of programming to get to a flag. First off, the service starts with a long menu

    GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR, CLEANUP EDITION
```

after which you're expected to input `GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR, CLEANUP EDITION`. The game rules and setup then follow and are pretty self-explanatory

```
In 2025, the world has been devastated by a nuclear attack and is a nuclear
wasteland. Luckily, the Chinese government has foreseen this disaster and
launched a satellite in orbit that is able to counter the nuclear waste.

Research has shown that nuclear waste is primarily composed of inverted tachyon
and positive lepton radiation, which cancel each other out.

The Chinese satellite uses inverted tachyons (-) and positive leptons (+) that
can each be fired in 9 different patterns over an area of 3 by 3 kilometers.

Your job is to clean up the nuclear waste by positioning the satellite,
selecting a firing mode (- or +) and a firing pattern (1 through 9), and then
firing.  The result will be instantaneous, the remaining contaminants per
square kilometer will be indicated on the screen.

Please note that firing the satellite costs money, which the post-apocalyptic
world is in short supply of: don't waste money! Good luck!

Keys:
        arrow keys: position satellite
        s or c: select firing mode and pattern
        f: fire satellite
        q: quit and let the world go to waste


Press enter to continue.

```

Following this you get a game grid which is colored, but looks like this underneath the ANSI coloring.

Clearly this grid is large enough that we can't just manually solve it for an answer, and furthermore we don't know what each "firing pattern" corresponds to. Also, there the setup also makes some mention of "don't waste money!" by firing too many shots. I'm not sure I ever ran into this constraint with my final solution, but it was something I considered but then forgot about in my solution.

Taking these issues one at a time, the first was to identify each "firing pattern". It turns out these are the same across each new instance of the game (thank you!), but the game board itself is randomly generated each time you connect. Ok, so it was easy enough to move the cursor, fire each pattern, and record the firing pattern as follows:

```
patterns s-9
 -2  0  2
  1  0  1
  0  1  1
patterns s-8
  2  1 -2
  0  0 -1
  0 -2 -1
patterns s-7
 -2 -1  2
  0  0  1
  1  2  1
patterns s-6
  4  0 -5
 -2  1 -2
 -1 -2 -2
patterns s-5
  3  0 -3
 -1  1 -2
 -1 -1 -1
patterns s-4
 -1  0  1
  0  1  0
  1  1  1
patterns s-3
  1 -1 -2
 -1  1 -1
  1  1  0
patterns s-2
 -1  0  5
  2 -3  1
 -1  0  1
patterns s-1
 -5  0  5
  1 -1  2
  1  2  2
patterns s+1
  5  0 -5
 -1  1 -2
 -1 -2 -2
patterns s+2
  1  0 -5
 -2  3 -1
  1  0 -1
patterns s+3
 -1  1  2
  1 -1  1
 -1 -1  0
patterns s+4
  1  0 -1
  0 -1  0
 -1 -1 -1
patterns s+5
 -3  0  3
  1 -1  2
  1  1  1
patterns s+6
 -4  0  5
  2 -1  2
  1  2  2
patterns s+7
  2  1 -2
  0  0 -1
 -1 -2 -1
patterns s+8
 -2 -1  2
  0  0  1
  0  2  1
patterns s+9
  2  0 -2
 -1  0 -1
  0 -1 -1
```

Using this I wrote up a small script to pair each of these up and see if there were any pairs of patterns which maximized the number of unaffected (0) positions. Helpfully, there were a couple pairs I found useful along with a couple notes.

```
patterns s+9 s+8
  0 -1  0
 -1  0  0
  0  1  0
patterns s-9 s-8  ******2.  1 (upper right), 3 (top row)
  0  1  0
  1  0  0
  0 -1  0
patterns s+9 s-7
  0 -1  0
 -1  0  0
  1  1  0
patterns s+8 s+7
  0  0  0
  0  0  0
 -1  0  0
patterns s+6 s+1
  1  0  0
  1  0  0
  0  0  0
patterns s-8 s-7   ******3
  0  0  0
  0  0  0
  1  0  0
patterns s-8 s+3
  1  2  0
  1 -1  0
 -1 -3 -1
patterns s-7 s-3  ******1.   2 (right column)
 -1 -2  0
 -1  1  0
  2  3  1
patterns s-9 s-3
 -1 -1  0
  0  1  0
  1  2  1
patterns s-7 s+4
 -1 -1  1
  0 -1  1
  0  1  0
patterns s-9 s+4
 -1  0  1
  1 -1  1
 -1  0  0
patterns s-6 s-2
  3  0  0
  0 -2 -1
 -2 -2 -1
patterns s-2 s+1
  4  0  0
  1 -2 -1
 -2 -2 -1
```

If it isn't clear, I was looking for a pattern which would only have one non-zero cell on a side or sides of the pair-pattern. Also, I should mention that if you fired on an edge, then nothing happened to the gameboard for the squares hanging over the edge (and off the gameboard).

## Writing a Solver

From here, I set about writing a (quite long) solver to iteratively set cells on the gameboard to zero. I started on the right-most column and used a brute force pattern to move down the column and set it to zeros with various patterns (`s-6`,`s-5`,`s-3`,`s+4`,`s-6 and s-2` and their inverses). With the rightmost column cleared, I moved across the board, using increasingly restrictive patterns to clear individual cells until I needed the `s-8 s-7` pair to clear a single cell at the end.

The full python code I wrote is given below, and can (hopefully) explain my solution much better than any description I give
