# OverTheWire Advent Bonanza 2018 Writeup

Enclosed is my writeup for the 2018 OTW Advent CTF (https://advent2018.overthewire.org). The challenges were tough, but a lot of fun. It seemed like the organizers created each challenge so that it had at least two pieces that needed to be solved before getting the flag. I liked this approach although sometimes it was frustrating when I'd solved some of the challenge, but not all of it. I worked on the CTF solo (team name IoN) and solved a good amount of problems but got stuck on a couple others. At some point I gave up trying to solve every problem and place highly and ended up just working on problems I found the most fun. The two high points of the competition for me were solving "Cryptocow" and "Elvish Art" second.
